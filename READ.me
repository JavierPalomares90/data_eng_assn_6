TO RUN: There is a main class in Driver.java that automates creating a SqlLite database, loading and querying the data using variation I and II through each of the index combinations
using the SqlLite jdbc drivers.
The class takes a path to the save location of the database as a runtime argument.
Additionally, when inserting 5 million rows, please increase the heap size by adding "-Xmx6144m -Xms1024m" to the VM options.
